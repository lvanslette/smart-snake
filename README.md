Play Snake against the Computer.

The issue right now is the display box is not aligning with the coordinates. The width and height of the box
containing the snake game is not corresponding to the assigned values of windowWidth and windowHeight. For example, the
print statement "You lose! Collision with the Wall: (-44, 176)" is displayed but the snake was traveling
within the box and shouldn't have a negative x-value.
